# Frontend Hiring Task: Routing Concepts, Hooks, and Other React Essentials

This project is a demonstration of the implementation of routing concepts, hooks, and other React essentials for a frontend hiring task. The task involves building a React app that fetches data from a server, displays the data in a table, and allows users to filter the data using a search bar. The app also incorporates React Router for enabling navigation between two pages.

## Features
- The server API used for fetching data is located at [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.].
- The table displays the following columns: "ID," "Title," "Body," and "User ID". The columns are sortable in ascending or descending order.
- The search bar allows users to filter the data by searching for keywords in the "Title" and "Body" columns.
- The app consists of two pages: the first page displays the full table data, and the second page displays a single post with its title and body when user clicks on the title.
- Pagination feature: The table has been enhanced with pagination functionality.
- UI library: Utilized Bootstrap to style the app and improve its visual appeal.
